# Project

## Introduction
* Description of the data and context
* What was the initial goal?
* Paper 

### Our questions
* Validate paper e.g. 
* confirm that connections in groups way more frequent
* how fast can information be spread? 
* centrality of the queen? or other ants (groups)
* Do any attributes indicate a certain position?

## Descriptive Statistics of the network
* Explore the network
* Mean, degree distribution, etc.
* Some Plots (maybe fancy ones)

## Model
* model the network with specific model

## Validation
* validate models?

## Conclusion
* Summary
* Validation paper?
* New insights?

## Statement of the division of labor 
* I did this


# To-Do

Analysis:
* histogram of degrees
* connectivity, components
* degree_distribution
* average.path.length
* diameter
* centrality measures
* global clustering coefficient

* Table to compare

* kmeans-clustering # Andrei
* Plot # Jan
* properties
